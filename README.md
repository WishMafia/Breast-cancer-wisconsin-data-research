# Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data Research

This repository contains research and analysis on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The primary objective of this project is to build and evaluate various machine learning models for the classification of breast cancer diagnosis.


## Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are critical for effective treatment. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign using features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass.

## Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is used for this research. It is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- **Number of Instances:** 569
- **Number of Features:** 30
- **Target Variable:** Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

## Methods
The following machine learning algorithms are used in this project:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- (Include any other algorithms you used)

The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. Various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the models.

## Results
The results of the classification models are compared and analyzed to determine the most effective model for this dataset. (Include a summary of your results here)

## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Run the Jupyter notebooks provided to see the analysis and results.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data-research.git
